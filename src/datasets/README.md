## Datasets

We trained our networks on 
[NYUv2](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v2.html), 
[SUNRGB-D](https://rgbd.cs.princeton.edu/), and 
[Cityscapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/). 
Furthermore, we also pretrained our best model on the synthetic dataset 
[SceneNet RGB-D](https://robotvault.bitbucket.io/scenenet-rgbd.html). 

This folder contains the code to prepare every dataset for training and 
evaluation.
